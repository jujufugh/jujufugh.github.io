# Sample Schema Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to setup your database schemas for the subsequent labs.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will setup sample schema:
* Set the environment variables
* Get the Database sample schemas and unzip them
* Install the Sample Schemas

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:

* A LiveLabs Cloud account and assigned compartment
* The IP address and instance name for your DB19c Compute instance
* Successfully logged into your LiveLabs account
* A Valid SSH Key Pair

## Task 1: Install Sample Data

In this step, you will install a selection of the Oracle Database Sample Schemas.  For more information on these schemas, please review the Schema agreement at the end of this lab.

By completing the instructions below the sample schemas **SH**, **OE**, and **HR** will be installed. These schemas are used in Oracle documentation to show SQL language concepts and other database features. The schemas themselves are documented in Oracle Database Sample Schemas [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=COMSC).

1. Run a *whoami* to ensure the value *oracle* comes back.)

    Note: If you are running in Windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0.
    ```
    <copy>whoami</copy>
    ```

2. If you are not the oracle user, log back in:
    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````

    ![substitute user oracle](./images/sudo-oracle.png " ")

3.  Set the environment variables to point to the Oracle binaries.  When prompted for the SID (Oracle Database System Identifier), enter **cdb1**.
    ````
    <copy>
    . oraenv
    </copy>
    ````
    ![environment variables](./images/oraenv.png " ")

4. Get the Database sample schemas and unzip them. Then set the path in the scripts.

    ````
    <copy>
    wget https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas/archive/v19c.zip
    unzip v19c.zip
    cd db-sample-schemas-19c
    perl -p -i.bak -e 's#__SUB__CWD__#'$(pwd)'#g' *.sql */*.sql */*.dat
    sed -i 's#COMPRESS,#,#g' sales_history/csh_v3.sql
    </copy>
    ````

    ![install schema](./images/install-schema-zip1.png " " )
    ![install schema](./images/install-schema-zip2.png " " )

5. Run this grep command to verify that the path was proprerly set. Nothing should return when you execute this command.

    ````
    <copy>
    grep 'CWD' */*.sql
    </copy>
    ````

6. Login using SQL*Plus as the **oracle** user and create TEST_DATA tablespace to prepare for sample schemas installation.  

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus system/Oracle123@localhost:1521/pdb1
    create tablespace TEST_DATA datafile '/u01/oradata/cdb1/pdb1/test_data.dbf' size 300m autoextend on extent management local uniform size 512K;
    </copy>
    ````
    ![start sqlplus](./images/start-sqlplus-create-tbs.png " ")

7.  Install the Sample Schemas by running the script below.

    ````
    <copy>
    @/home/oracle/DBSecLab/db-sample-schemas-19c/sales_history/sh_main Oracle123 test_data temp Oracle123 /home/oracle/DBSecLab/db-sample-schemas-19c/sales_history/ /home/oracle/ v3 localhost:1521/pdb1
    create index sh.sales_cust_channel_promo_idx on sh.sales(cust_id, channel_id, promo_id);
    </copy>
    ````

    ````
    <copy>
    col table_name for a30
    set line 2000 pages 2000
    select table_name, num_rows from user_tables order by table_name;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![schema installed](./images/tables-created.png " " )

    Make a note of the current segment type and the space the segmenet occupies

    ````
    <copy>
    select SEGMENT_TYPE,count(*),sum(bytes/(1024*1024)) SIZE_MB 
    from dba_segments 
    where TABLESPACE_NAME in ('TEST_DATA') 
    and SEGMENT_TYPE in ('TABLE', 'TABLE PARTITION', 'INDEX PARTITION', 'INDEX')
    group by SEGMENT_TYPE order by SEGMENT_TYPE;
    </copy>
    ````
   
8.  Exit SQL Plus to the oracle user.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

    ![return to opc](images/return-to-opc.png)

9.  Create gzip backup of the sample data datafile (storage compression simulation)

    **Note**: Your numbers maybe slighlty different then what is shown in the screenshot, but the point is to show that compression has occured. As long is that is still shown for you, you are good to keep going through the lab.

    ````
    <copy>
    du -hs /u01/oradata/cdb1/pdb1/test_data.dbf
    cp /u01/oradata/cdb1/pdb1/test_data.dbf /u01/oradata/test_data.dbf
    </copy>
    ````
    ````
    <copy>
    gzip /u01/oradata/test_data.dbf
    du -hs /u01/oradata/test_data.dbf.gz
    </copy>
    ````
    ![return to opc](images/storage-compress-simulation.png)

    As you can see, we just backed up the test_data.dbf datafile and compressed it from 317MB to 17MB.

**Congratulations!** Now you have the environment to run the labs.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.

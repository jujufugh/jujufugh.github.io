# Introduction

## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 60 minutes

This workshop is designed to show you how to use Transparent Data Encryption and Advanced Compression together and the its benefits.

Transparent Data Encryption has been implemented by many customers to protect sensitive data, but in doing so, they have discovered that storage level compression is no longer a viable solution. Customers are now seeking an integrated solution that not only provides encryption of their data but also enables them to save storage space by compressing encrypted data. This integrated solution of Oracle Transparent Data Encryption and Oracle Advanced Compression not only enhances data security but also reduces the overall costs of storing data in a secure manner, allowing organizations to allocate their resources more efficiently.

With this lab, you will not need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your rhythm this integrated solution.

### Components
It's composed of 1 VM:
- **DBSec-Lab VM** (mandatory for all workshops: Baseline and Advanced workshops)

During this lab, you will use the SSH terminal client to interact with this VM.

So that your experience of this workshop is the best possible, DO NOT FORGET to perform "Lab: *Initialize Environment*" to be sure that all these resources are correctly set!

### Objectives
This Hands-On Labs give the user an opportunity to learn how to configure Advanced Compression and Transparent Data Encryption to protect their data at rest while also saving space within the database.

In this mini-lab, you will learn how to use the **Oracle Transparent Data Encryption** and **Oracle Advanced Compression** together.

We wish you an excellent workshop!

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
